# JYY Quiz
A quiz for JYU freshers
## Description
A contract work developed for The Student Union of Jyv채skyl채. The goal was to develop a quiz for freshers in order to better accommodate them to the city of Jyv채skyl채. 
## Dev notes
First and foremost this project was an introduction to Vanilla javascript developing and some more in-depth use of CSS. Hence some things such as encapsulation have been noticeably neglected and put aside in favor of schedule in the face of timely code refactoring.

Worth noting, a fully fledged Bellman Ford pathfinding algorithm was implemented in the production of the game map. Creating it was, among other things, a notable takeaway and a valuable learning experience during the project.

Since the completion of this project I have moved on to learning React and Node.js and have found my productivity and code clarity improve significantly.
